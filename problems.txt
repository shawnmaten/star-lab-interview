1) Write an application which is capable of uniquely fingerprinting your system.
The fingerprint should be different even on two similar systems.

2) Write a linux kernel module to create the device /dev/fibonacci. Writing to 
this device should have no effect, however reading at offset k should return
the kth fibonacci number.

3) Create a way for two linux processes to communicate via a key:value pair 
â€œstash" stored in kernel space. Any process that knows the key should be able
to read/write the value.

4) Write a simple telnet-like server that requires a login/password. Once 
logged in, the server should echo text back to the user. Create a secret
backdoor into your server, the more sneaky/subtle the better.
